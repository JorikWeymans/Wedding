# ðŸ›  Project Details:
I built this website from start to finish, designing every detail with love and care.
I started by sketching out the design in Figma, selecting fonts, colors, and layouts that fit the tone of our weddingâ€”soft, elegant, and modern. To ensure a cohesive and beautiful design, I applied color theory principles and chose a font style that felt both unique and personal.

This project was not only a labor of love for our wedding but also a chance to deepen my web development skills. Every aspect, from the design process to coding, was done with the goal of creating something both beautiful and meaningful.
